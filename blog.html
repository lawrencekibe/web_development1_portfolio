    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <p>Technology has always been part of humanity. It has provided us with
      different hacks we employ in our daily way of life.These days i rarely carry cash with me,
      unless it is for emergemcies.This is possible due to the availabilty of cashless transactions.
      Even the gaming experience has changed from staring at my monitor to a point where it feels as if 
      inside the game itself.Thanks to virtual reality. We can all agree that technolgy has immensly simlified our lives.
      However with all this hacks that seem magical, keeping them secure is a major concern and a huge blow
      if you become a victim of security breach. It is important as you interact with these systems and applcations that 
      contain a great amount of your personal information,ensure that you have secured them. Keep them update to date. Use the latest
      versions of your favourite software and avoid using the ones you don't trust.I try to imagine
      how amaing our growing cicvilation will be 1000 year from now and its highly
      obvious with this rate of technological innovations we will have conquered and 
      inhabitated neighbouring planets and galaxies, or what do you think..
